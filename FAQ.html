            <h4 class="text-body">
                We have many safety procedures in place in order to protect children. We start by hiring only the
                most
                highly qualified and passionate individuals with clear FBI backgrounds, from enforcing our drop off
                and
                pick up procedure, to having cameras outside of our building as well as in our classrooms.

            <h4 class="text-body">
                We are all about creating a fun learning experience for our children. All of our classrooms,
                including
                the infants follow a specific curriculum. The curriculum is hands-on research based and promotes
                creativity. Lesson plans designed by the teachers encourage development in Language, Emerging
                Literacy,
                Math & Science, Gross Motor Skills, Creativity & Art, Social Skills, Physical Activity, Emotional

                We are opened 7 days a week from 6:30am-10:00pm. Children may be enrolled at full time or part time

            </h3>
            <h4 class="text-body">
                Yes, you may send your child with their own food from home or they can eat meals provided by the
                center.
                Children may not have home food AND food from the school. Parents must provide all food for infants,
                including milk.

                What are your ratios?
            </h3>
            <h4 class="text-body">
                Georgiaâ€™s licensing agency Bright from The Start allows a ratio of 1:6 for Family Home Learning
                Centers,
                depending on the ages of the children. However, we will never have a ratio greater than 1:5 in our
                classrooms in order to ensure your child is receiving enough love and attention. There will be at
                least
                2 adults in center for part of the day, and younger children such as infants and those who do not
                walk
                will not spend much time in a mixed age group setting with older children.
