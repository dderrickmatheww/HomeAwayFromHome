            <p>
Hello! My name is Cyasia J Zackery and I am twenty-six years old. I am originally from Pennsylvania and relocated to Savannah three years ago after graduating from The Pennsylvania State University with an Associate degree in Human Development and Family Studies. More recently, I graduated from Southern Crescent Technical College with a Certificate in Early Childhood Program Administration. Children have always been a passion of mine and I have over eight years of professional child care experience. My past job titles include Paraprofessional, Lead day care teacher, Therapeutic Staff Support, and Babysitter. What I love most about working with children is helping and watching them grow and learn. My natural creativity and fun personality always makes my experiences with children unique and special. 
            </p>

            <div class="Qoute">
            <p>
                I tend to give each child I work with lots of love and attention, as if they were my own.
            </p>   
            <p>
                That’s what makes us so different at Home Away from Home!

            FAQ
            </h2>
        <p>
       <h4> 
           How do you ensure safety in your programs?
        </h4>
    <h3>
 We have many safety procedures in place in order to protect children. We start by hiring only the most highly qualified and passionate individuals with clear FBI backgrounds, from enforcing our drop off and pick up procedure, to having cameras outside of our building as well as in our classrooms.
    </h3>   
    <br>
<h4> 
    Will my child be learning?
</h4>
<h3>  
We are all about creating a fun learning experience for our children. All of our classrooms, including the infants follow a specific curriculum. The curriculum is hands-on research based and promotes creativity. Lesson plans designed by the teachers encourage development in Language, Emerging Literacy, Math & Science, Gross Motor Skills, Creativity & Art, Social Skills, Physical Activity, Emotional Skills, Reasoning, Problem Solving and more.
</h3>
<h4>
   What are your hours of operation? 
</h4>   
 <h3>
    We are opened 7 days a week from 6:30am-10:00pm. Children may be enrolled at full time or part time status for AM or PM care but not both.
 </h3>
<h4>
   Can I provide my own food? 
</h4>
<h3>
Yes, you may send your child with their own food from home or they can eat meals provided by the center. Children may not have home food AND food from the school. Parents must provide all food for infants, including milk. 
</h3>
<h4>What are your ratios?</h4>
<h3>   
Georgia’s licensing agency Bright from The Start allows a ratio of 1:6 for Family Home Learning Centers, depending on the ages of the children. However, we will never have a ratio greater than 1:5 in our classrooms in order to ensure your child is receiving enough love and attention. There will be at least 2 adults in center for part of the day, and younger children such as infants and those who do not walk will not spend much time in a mixed age group setting with older children.
 </h3>    
<h4>What are your rates?</h4>
<h3>    
Our weekly tuition rates are affordable for most families. Call to schedule a tour for more information.
